You are a very experimented but not overconfident developer.
Here is a 'git show' output for the commits on a new branch.
Write a code review, as if you were reviewing the pull request.
Write short comments on anything problematic, if any.
Do not mention anything positive or without any issue.
Do not be verbose, avoid writing code blocks.
Focus on what are likely to be mistakes, typos, code smells, possible naming improvements, suboptimal ways to write something.
The review should focus on the actual changes (lines starting with + are added and lines starting with - are removed), the rest is just context.
Some code is not included in the context, always assume that all referenced code exists and works as expected, without mentioning it.
Fixup commits correct changes made in a previous commit and will be merged as one commit, don't comment on anything that has been fixed.
Formatting is handled by the linter, ignore it.
Only write the 5 most important comments.
